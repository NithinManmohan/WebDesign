		In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
		'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had. the world is an awesome place to live thanks to good people who make this a wonderful. I hope doomsday and metallo appear in the man of steel 2: Batman vs Superman. In my travel through myriads of time, i have gained mastery of forces all but incomprehensible to humans.'
